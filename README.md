```
Checks if value is an empty object, collection, map, or set. Objects are considered empty if they have no own enumerable string keyed properties. Array-like values such as arguments objects, arrays, buffers, strings, or jQuery-like collections are considered empty if they have a length of 0. Similarly, maps and sets are considered empty if they have a size of 0.
```
### set: [Function]
```
Set a hash of attributes (one or many) on the model. If any of the attributes change the model's state, a "change" event will be triggered on the model. Change events for specific attributes are also triggered, and you can bind to those as well, for example: change:title, and change:content. You may also pass individual keys and values.
```
### omit: [Function]
```
Return a copy of the object, filtered to omit the disallowed keys (or array of keys). Alternatively accepts a predicate indicating which keys to omit.
